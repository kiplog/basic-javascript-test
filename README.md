More note in this PDF : http://paulmccann.com/webdev4/javascript-test-questions.pdf

## Part I - basics

Where does JavaScript go?

Name 5 JavaScript events. Be prepared to use them later.

Name the parts of an inline event handler. Name the parts of a function.

Name a few ways to get elements out of an HTML document. How do you get an ID? The first div on a page? A class name? The value of a form element?

Explain the difference between an object and an array. Describe why you'd use one or the other.

Name some methods of an array.

## Part II - coding

Using a function, create a message, and writes that message to a div with an ID. Create another message and write that to the first div in the document.

Display the time, with running seconds in the middle of the screen, in the Raleway Extra Light (200) font (from Google fonts).

Move the duck. Write a script that takes the 2 inputs from a form, an x and y number, and sets the absolute position of an image on a page to that position. Extra credit or animating the movement.

Fizz buzz test with CSS styling. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


## Part III - ES6

Explain the difference between let, var and const.

Explain what 'use strict' does.

Explain what lexical vs. block scope means.

Demonstrate the fat arrow and describe when you would use it, and name a situation when you wouldn't want to use it.

Demonstrate the use of template literals

Explain your philosophy on semicolons. Prepare to defend your position to the death.
